I initialized this directory for git:

git init .
git add .
git commit -m "First commit"
git config --global user.name "Ben Holder"
git config --global user.email holderbp@gmail.com

and then uploaded this directory to a github repository:

git remote add origin https://github.com/holderbp/hivgfp_tcd_teeeivgamma.git
git remote -v
git push
git push -u origin master

By following these instructions:

https://help.github.com/en/github/importing-your-projects-to-github/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line

Then I did:

> git status
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
    README
    README~

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

which showed that this new README file is untracked. 

To add it to the repository, I did:

> git add README*

and then I had:

> git status
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
    new file:   README
    new file:   README~

And I can now re-commit by doing

git commit -m "Added README file"
